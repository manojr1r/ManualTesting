What is Manual Testing?

Well, according to me, testers don't just log bugs. We try to understand the goals and objectives of the product thoroughly. Manual testing is more than just executing predefined test cases; it involves a comprehensive exploration of the software to ensure its functionality, usability, and overall quality align with the intended purpose.

In manual testing, testers engage with the software as end-users would, navigating through different features and scenarios to identify potential issues or areas for improvement. This hands-on approach allows us to not only detect bugs but also provide valuable feedback on the user experience, performance, and alignment with business objectives.

Furthermore, manual testing enables testers to apply critical thinking and problem-solving skills to uncover unforeseen issues that automated testing might overlook. By actively interacting with the software in diverse environments and scenarios, we can simulate real-world usage conditions and ensure the product's resilience and reliability.
